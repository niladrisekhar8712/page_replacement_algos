# Page Replacement Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various **Page Replacement Algorithms** commonly used in Operating Systems for managing memory. These algorithms help determine which memory pages to swap out when a new page needs to be loaded into memory.

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Implemented

- **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**  
  Replaces the oldest page in memory.

- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**  
  Replaces the page that hasn't been used for the longest time.

- **Optimal Page Replacement**  
  Replaces the page that will not be used for the longest time in the future. (Requires future knowledge, used as a benchmark.)

- **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**

  Replaces the page with the lowest frequency of accesses. A problem arises when a page is used heavily in initial cases and then never used again. Since it was used heavily, it has a large count, even though it is no longer used.
